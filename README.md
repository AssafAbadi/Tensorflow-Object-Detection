# Tensorflow Object Detection
 
Sure! Here's an updated GitHub description for the Gesture Detection project, including the libraries I used:

Gesture Detection with Tensorflow Object Detection
As part of the AI-powered Object Detection course, I built a deep learning model using Tensorflow Object Detection (TFOD) to detect four different gestures. This project showcases my skills in image labeling, model training, and model evaluation, utilizing various libraries such as Matplotlib for visualization.

Technologies and Tools Utilized:
Tensorflow Object Detection (TFOD)
Python
LabelImg for image labeling
Matplotlib for visualization
Project Highlights:
Collect and label images for training using LabelImg
Train a deep learning model for gesture detection using TFOD and Python
Fine-tune the model to improve precision and recall
Test the model in real-time using a webcam and images
Visualize model performance using Matplotlib
Gain hands-on experience in object detection with TFOD and Python
How to Run the Project:

1.Install Tensorflow Object Detection on your local machine or on Google Colab following the instructions provided in the course.

2.Use LabelImg or any other image labeling tool to collect and label images for training.

3.Train the gesture detection model using the provided Python code and Tensorflow Object Detection API.

4.Fine-tune the model as needed to optimize its accuracy.

5.Test the model using a webcam or images to detect the four different gestures in real-time.

6.Visualize the model's performance using Matplotlib for further analysis.
